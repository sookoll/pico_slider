pico_slider
===========

Create sliders(image lists) inside the [Pico CMS](http://pico.dev7studios.com/).

### Use Cases

This plugin really just reads images and outputs them in an array to be used on the front end. You could use any slider library that you want really. I like Swipe because I just find it to be the best since there is no jQuery required and it works amazingly well on mobile devices.

### Installation

* Clone this repo into your plugins folder.
* Do not change the name. Leave it as `pico_slider`.
* Download [Swipe](https://github.com/bradbirdsall/Swipe) or some other slider lib.
* Setup the sliders JS and CSS files.
* Create a folder inside `content` called `images`. Path would be `{pico_root}/content/images/`.
* Inside that folder, drop all the images you want to use. (structure can be changed, defaut is `.jpg` images)
* Add the markup into your theme or mardown file
* Have fun!

### Markup

This is specific to [Swipe](https://github.com/bradbirdsall/Swipe). You can do whatever you like for your slider library.

```html
<div id="slider" class='swipe'>
  <div class="swipe-wrap">
    {% for image in images %}
      <div class="swipe-slide">
        <img src="{{ image.url }}" alt="{{ image.name }}" width="{{ image.width }}" height="{{ image.height }}">
      </div>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Image properties

Here is what is stored in each image item.

```php
$image = array(
  'name' = 'mylittlepony', // basically just the file name without the extension
  'width' = 900,
  'height' = 600,
  'url' = 'content/image/mylittlepony.jpg' // basically just the base_url + the image url
);
```

### Customizing Paths and Extensions

By default the plugin will only grab `.jpg` images from `content/images` folder. This can be changed in the Pico `config.php` file.

```php
$config['slider_path'] = 'content/images/slider'; // the path to the folder you want to use for loading the images
$config['slider_ext'] = '.jpg'; // the extension of the files you are looking for
```
